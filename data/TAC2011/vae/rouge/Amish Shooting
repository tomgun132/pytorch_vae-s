Two state troopers on horseback and a funeral director 's black sedan with flashing yellow lights led the cortege , followed by a long horse-drawn buggy carrying the body of 7-year-old Naomi Rose Ebersol .
All roads leading into the village of Nickel Mines were blocked by state police so the Amish could gather privately in homes to remember Ebersol ; Marian Fisher , 13 ; and sisters Mary Liz Miller , 8 , and Lena Miller , 7 .
Charles Carl Roberts IV revealed to his family in notes he left behind and in a cell phone call from inside the West Nickel Mines Amish School that he was tormented by memories of molesting two young relatives 20 years ago .
Roberts , his wife and three children -- two boys and one girl ages about 1 to 7 -- lived in the tiny village of Georgetown , Pa. , 55 miles west of Philadelphia and a short drive from the school .
