`` Athletes understand how important training is , and nutrition , but there 's a third component that makes a big difference in how they perform -- sleep , '' says Cheri Mah , lead author of the study presented last week at the Associated Professional Sleep Societies ' meeting in Minneapolis .
Research by Cornell University 's James Maas , who is credited with coining the term `` power nap , '' revealed that nearly four in 10 American workers admit napping on the job , snoozing in bathroom stalls , at their desks ( under them , too ) or in their cars in company parking lots .
The study , carried out by researchers at Warwick Medical School at the University of Warwick , Britain , involved 5,766 volunteers ( 4,199 men and 1,567 women ) from 20 London-based civil service departments , according to a press release from the university on Friday .
Sustained sleep curtailment , ensuing excessive daytime sleepiness , and the higher cardiovascular risk are causes for concern with emerging evidence suggesting a potential role for sleep deprivation as a predictor or risk factor for conditions such as obesity and diabetes , according to Professor Francesco Cappuccio , who led the research .
